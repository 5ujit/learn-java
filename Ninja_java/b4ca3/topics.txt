Sure, here's a breakdown of the topics for Units V and VI:

**Unit V: Exceptions and Assertions** 
1. Exception overview
   - What is an exception?
   - Why do exceptions occur?
2. Exception class hierarchy and exception types
   - Checked exceptions
   - Unchecked exceptions
   - Errors
3. Propagation of exceptions
   - How exceptions propagate through the call stack
4. Using try, catch, and finally for exception handling
   - Syntax and usage of try-catch blocks
   - Finally block for cleanup actions
5. Usage of throw and throws
   - Throwing exceptions manually
   - Declaring exceptions with the throws keyword
6. Handling multiple exceptions using multi-catch
   - Catching multiple exceptions in a single catch block
7. Autoclose resources with try-with-resources statement
   - Automatic resource management using try-with-resources
8. Creating custom exceptions
   - Extending the Exception class or one of its subclasses
9. Testing invariants by using assertions
   - Using assertions to validate assumptions in code

**Unit VI: Collections and Generics**
1. Creating a custom generic class
   - Syntax for defining generic classes
2. Using the type inference diamond to create an object
   - Diamond operator <>
3. Using bounded types and Wildcards
   - Specifying upper and lower bounds for type parameters
   - Using wildcard types (?)
4. Creating a collection by using generics
   - Creating parameterized collections like ArrayList, HashMap, etc.
5. Implementing an ArrayList
   - Understanding the ArrayList data structure and methods
6. Implementing TreeSet using Comparable and Comparator interfaces
   - Sorting elements in a TreeSet
   - Implementing custom sorting logic using Comparable and Comparator interfaces
7. Implementing a HashMap
   - Understanding the HashMap data structure and methods
8. Implementing a Deque
   - Understanding the Deque interface and its implementations

These topics cover a broad range of Java programming concepts related to exceptions handling, input/output operations, collections, and generics.
